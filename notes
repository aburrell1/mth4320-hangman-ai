Dimensions of matrices:

There are n words in a phrase.
Convert each word into a size 5 array such as

number_of_samples = number of words in phrase = n = 7
number of classes = c = 615
number of features for each word = f = 5

for each word guess:
x --> (1 x f)
w --> (f x c)
y --> (1 x c)

y should be n copies of a 1d array of size c representing c classes


Example:

Let's say we had the word florida:
florida --> [2, 7, 'f', 'c', 0]
w --> matrix of size 5 by 615 (use softmax)
output y --> (1 x 615) which is a list of probabilities.

Choose index with highest probability value found in y.
